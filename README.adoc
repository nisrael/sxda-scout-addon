= Additional Form Fields for Eclipse Scout

This project provides wrapper modules for popular open-source web widgets as form field extensions for the https://eclipse.dev/scout/[Eclipse Scout] framework. The modules wrap browser-based widgets into Scout form fields, following Scout's client-server architecture and providing a familiar Scout API for Java developers.

== Available Modules

* **Ace Editor** - Wrapper for the https://ace.c9.io[Ace Code Editor]
* **CodeMirror** - Wrapper for https://codemirror.net/[CodeMirror 6]
* **Monaco Editor** - Wrapper for the https://microsoft.github.io/monaco-editor/[Monaco Editor] (VS Code editor)

The project is not limited to code editors and can be extended with wrappers for any open-source web widget (charts, rich text editors, data grids, calendars, etc.).
