# Notices for Addon for Eclipse Scout

The contents of the initial commit to this repository were copied from the
parts of the [scout.rt repository](https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt)
of the [Eclipse Scout](https://eclipse.dev/scout/) project that contained the
Charts form field modules:

* [eclipse-scout-chart](https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt/tree/releases/23.1/eclipse-scout-chart)
* [org.eclipse.scout.rt.chart.client](https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt/tree/releases/23.1/org.eclipse.scout.rt.chart.client)
* [org.eclipse.scout.rt.chart.ui.html](https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.rt/tree/releases/23.1/org.eclipse.scout.rt.chart.ui.html)

It was adapted to provide a basis for other form field extensions to the Eclipse Scout Framework.

The demo application borrows parts from the [ScoutJS widgets demo application](https://github.com/eclipse-scout/scout.docs/tree/releases/23.2/code/widgets).
